== Description ==

Insert [CopySafe Web](http://www.artistscope.com/copysafe_web_protection.asp) encrypted images to copy protect all media including image, Flash, PDF and video from right-click-saving, mouse-drag, Print Screen and screen capture. By using this plugin to simply adding a small CopySafe encrypted image you can add the most secure copy protection to any page or post.

* Easy install.
* Upload and embed CopySafe Web using WordPress native media tools.
* Insert encrypted images into posts or pages using a media button.
* Ability to set varying levels of protection per page or post.
* Control which web browsers can access your protected pages.
* Checks the CopySafe Web plugin for redirection and install.
* Manage settings to control image display options.
* Add copy protection to by adding just a 20 x 20 pixel image.
* Protection for all media from Printscreen and screen capture.

If a visitor does not have the appropriate plugin installed for their web browser, they are redirected to instructions with a download link. Because browser detection is dependent on JavaScript, if a visitor has JavaScript disabled they also will be redirected for instructions on how to correct their browser settings. These download and instruction pages are included in the plugin's folder and can be customized to suit your own messages and design.

More information and online demos protecting a variety of different media can be seen at the [CopySafe Web Protection](http://www.artistscope.com/copysafe_web_protection.asp) site. 

You can see this plugin and our other WP copy protection plugins in action on our [WordPress demo website](http://wordpress.artistscope.com).

** Implementation **

Click on the [C] media button above a post to upload and embed CopySafe Web encrypted images in your current post or page. When inserting a protected image object, the necessary shortcode is automatically inserted into the post editor. 

You can upload new image class documents or select from a list of already uploaded class files. After selecting an image class file you can then set the security options to apply to the page such as:

* Enable or disable protection from Printscreen and screen capture
* Enable or disable the option viewing by computers using remote or virtual connections
* Enable or disable use of browser menus
* Enable or disable use of the keyboard

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload the "wp-copysafe-web" folder and its contents to the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Create a new folder at "/wp-content/uploads/copysafe-web"
4. Set write permissions on this new folder
5. Check and modify the default settings to suit your pages
6. You can now add CopySafe Web images using its media button above the post editor

If you do not have any CopySafe Web encrypted images for testing, you can download this [test file](http://www.artistscope.com/download/cs/icon_0020_0020_C.zip) which satisfies the file type criteria. It is licensed for "localhost" so you can activate capture protection on your test server.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can this plugin be used without CopySafe? =

Yes. By leaving mode set to demo, an icon will be displayed instead of the object code, but no-right-click saving and drag-n-drop will still be prevented, and you will still be able to control which web browsers can access the page.

= Which web browsers are supported by this plugin? =

All popular web browsers are supported on all Windows platforms since XP (92% of net users).

= What can be done for Mac or Linux computers? =

Nothing that is safe from Print Screen or screen capture. However if you want to use encrypted images for Mac and Linux computers, which are a much more secure solution than anything based on JavaScript, you could use the WP Secure Image plugin. Instead of using ActiveX, Secure Image uses a java security applet to display the image that is supported in all browsers and on all platforms.

== Screenshots ==

1. To add a CopySafe Web image at the last cursor position in the text area, click the [C] media button.
2. After uploading or selecting an existing class image, nominate the settings to apply to the page or post.
3. Here you can nominate the default settings that apply to all CopySafe Web pages.
4. A file list can be displayed showing all CopySafe Web images that have been uploaded.

* The CopySafe Web is supported on all Windows computers since XP.
* CopySafe Web images are encrypted and domain locked.

* All media can be protected by using only a tiny encrypted image.

**Limitations**

* CopySafe Web is not supported on Mac. However it is supported on all Windows computers since XP (92% of net users). It is not possible to properly secure web content on Mac, Linux or any handheld devices not running Windows 8. All other platforms in total remain a minority. As such supporting them is not viable and doing so would only undermine the standard that CopySafe Web clients require.

**Licensing benefits**

* CopySafe Web is the most secure image protection on the planet.
* CopySafe Web images cannot be copied or used on other sites.

**Other modules**

CopySafe Web is specially designed for a wide variety of scenarios.

* The CopySafe Web converter is available as Windows desktop software.
* Converter operable by Command-line on Windows computers and servers.
* Custom DLLs are available to interface CMD version with web scripts.

**Alternatives**

CopySafe Web is most secure for "images" and while it can prevent Print Screen and screen capture for any other media that can be displayed on a web page, there are other solutions specially designed for specific media that will be more secure. For example [CopySafe PDF Protector](http://www.artistscope.com/copysafe_pdf_protection.asp) is specially designed for PDF documents. For online viewing only, the [ArtistScope Site Protection System (ASPS)](http://www.artistscope.com/artis-secure-web-reader.asp) uses a secure web browser that is properly designed to protect web media rather than expose it. Soon [ArtistScope Secure Video](http://www.artistscope.com/secure_video_protection.asp) will be available that is specially designed for video files. Each of these solutions have WordPress plugins or widgets available for easy integration into your WordPress project.
